# Project Name

Assigmnet on Advances Regression using regularization techniques


## General Information

Problem Statement:
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. The company wants to know

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house
- How well those variables describe the price of a house
Business Goal:
- Prepare regression model the predict price of the house
- Identify top features affeting price of a house
DataSet:
- Dataset is collected by suprising housing and same is providede in train.csv


## Conclusions
- With applying normal linear regression the model overfits in training data. 
- After applying Ridge and Lasso regularization the test data accuracy is improved


## Libraries  Used
- pandas
- sklearn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
